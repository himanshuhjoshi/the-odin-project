    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe for baked potatoes is delicious with steak, meatloaf, or by itself. 
        I never was a fan of the potato's skin until I began making this recipe!
         These potatoes taste amazing loaded with cheese, sour cream, and/or chives!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven</li>
        <li>Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high until melted, 20 to 30 seconds. Stir in olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to poke about 5 holes into each potato. Place each potato on a sheet of aluminum foil about 6 inches wide. Brush butter mixture over potatoes, making sure to evenly coat each one. Wrap up completely in foil. Poke 5 more holes into the wrapped potatoes.</li>
        <li>Bake potatoes in the center of the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Spread leftover butter mixture over potatoes after cutting them open.</li>
